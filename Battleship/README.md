# Battleship
This is a program that displays a 4x4 grid, and prompts the user to guess were the "battleship" is. Then the user's guess are run through depending on their diffuculty level. These results are then stored in the leaderboard.txt which at the end of the script is displayed, to show that users ranking. All is done in the command line.
